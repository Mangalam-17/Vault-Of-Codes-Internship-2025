- Each card shows internship details and a "View Details" button

## 💻 Live Preview

---

## 📄 index.html

This file contains the markup for the internship cards and general page layout.


## 📄 style.css
🚩 Style Highlights
• Box shadows, rounded corners for a modern card look.
• Grid layout automatically arranges internship cards side by side.
• Hover effects make cards and buttons interactive and visually appealing.
• Responsive up to 2 columns—you can tweak for mobile layouts if desired.

### 🌐 Why Use example.com?
`example.com` is a domain reserved for documentation and demonstration.
It’s safe and guaranteed not to be a real company or page.
Important:
• Replace `https://example.com` in your code with your actual internship page/app link when you deploy.
• Using `example.com` ensures your demo won’t mislead users or redirect them to unintended sites!
References:
• IANA Reserved Domains: example.com, example.net, and example.org are reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority for documentation purposes.
🚀 How to Use 1. Download both `index.html` and `style.css` in the same directory. 2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser. 3. Edit the file to update internship details, add your own button links, or tweak styles as needed.

### 📝 Customization Tips
• To add more internships, copy-paste the div with class `"card"`.
• Change colors and fonts in the CSS file to suit your brand.
• For actual deployment, update the button URLs for each internship.
