#### 🌐 Why Use example.com?
- `example.com` is a domain reserved for documentation and demonstration.
- It’s safe and guaranteed not to be a real company or page.

#### Important:
- Replace `https://example.com` in your code with your actual internship page/app link when you deploy.
- Using `example.com` ensures your demo won’t mislead users or redirect them to unintended sites!

#### References:
- IANA Reserved Domains: example.com, example.net, and example.org are reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority for documentation purposes.

#### 🚀 How to Use 
- 1. Download both `index.html` and `style.css` in the same directory. 
- 2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser. 
- 3. Edit the file to update internship details, add your own button links, or tweak styles as needed.

#### 📝 Customization Tips
- To add more internships, copy-paste the div with class `"card"`.
- Change colors and fonts in the CSS file to suit your brand.
- For actual deployment, update the button URLs for each internship.
